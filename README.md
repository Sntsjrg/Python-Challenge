Total months in the dataset.

 Net total "Profit/Losses."
 
Monthly changes in "Profit/Losses" and their average.

# PyPoll

Developed a Python script to modernize vote counting in a small town's election. The dataset, "election_data.csv," includes "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate" columns. In this challenge I calculated:

Total votes cast.

List of candidates receiving votes.

Percentage of votes for each candidate.

Total votes for each candidate.

Determined the election winner based on the popular vote.
